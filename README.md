This repository is based on a movie dataset used to build a recommender system, together with a Flask web app to simulate the user interaction with the movie catalog, his/her ratings, and recommendations.

The recommendation system is based on surprise.SVD and it has been described in [this](https://medium.com/@gabri-albini/building-a-movie-recommender-web-app-from-scratch-with-svd-and-flask-part-1-ff4d39b837ea) Medium post.

The guiding process to build the webapp is presented in [this](https://medium.com/@gabri-albini/building-a-movie-recommender-web-app-from-scratch-with-svd-and-flask-part-2-ba8a7b34b020) Medium post.
